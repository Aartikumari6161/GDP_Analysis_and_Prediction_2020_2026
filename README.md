# GDP_Analysis_and_Prediction_2020_2026
ðŸ“Œ Project: GDP Analysis and Prediction (2020â€“2026)  This project focuses on analyzing historical GDP data and predicting future trends between 2020 and 2026 using Python and data science techniques.


ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Cleaning and preprocessing GDP data.

Visualizing trends, growth rates, and country-level comparisons.

Feature Engineering:

Extracting important variables influencing GDP growth.

Handling missing values and scaling where required.

Modeling & Prediction:

Applied machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Time Series forecasting, or other regressors) to predict GDP for 2020â€“2026.

Evaluated model performance with appropriate metrics.

Visualization:

Line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to show GDP growth patterns.

Future GDP predictions plotted for clarity.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for implementation and visualization

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes:

Provides insights into GDP trends.

Predicts future GDP values up to 2026, which can help in policy analysis, business planning, and economic studies.
